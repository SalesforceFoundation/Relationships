        <label>Auto-created Relationships allow a custom Contact lookup field on the Contact or Campaign Member objects to automatically trigger the creation of a new Relationship type of your choice. For example, you might have a “Referred by” lookup field on the Campaign Member object to represent when a person new to your organisation was brought to an event by an existing constituent. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://powerofus.force.com/NPSP_Relationships_Settings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPSP Documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.</label>

        <label>FieldsDescribes Limit has been exceeded, may not be able to show all available fields.  

There are more than 100 custom fields defined on the Contact or Campaign Member object. If the field you wish to use is not shown, you may need to enter this Auto-Create record manually.  Go to Setup-&gt;Develop-&gt;Custom Settings and click &apos;Manage&apos; next to &apos;Relationship Auto-Create&apos;, then click &apos;New&apos; to enter a new record manually.  Use API names (not the field label) to identify the fields that should trigger a new Relationship record.</label>
